Homework 5

To compile my code:
Type qmake -project, then qmake, then make.
The code runs with ./hw5 because that is the directory it is in.

To Pass just click PASS.

To exchange type the letters you want to exchange
into the lineEdit next to exchange, and then press the EXCHANGE button.

To place, type the letters into the lineEdit next to place, then click
on the button where you want your word to start, and then click
either the horizontal or vertical button, then press PLACE.

The board shows the turn, the scores, the number of tiles left
in the bag, and displays a popup when the game ends.
